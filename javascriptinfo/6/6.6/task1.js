// Modify the code of makeCounter() so that the counter can also decrease and set the number:

// counter() should return the next number (as before).
// counter.set(value) should set the counter to value.
// counter.decrease() should decrease the counter by 1.
// See the sandbox code for the complete usage example.

function makeCounter() {
    let count = 0;
  
    function counter() {
      return count++;
    }
  
    counter.set = value => count = value;
  
    counter.decrease = () => count--;
  
    return counter;
  }
